description: Learning all the things ... opportunities are what you make of them and the opportunity before me is to learn all the things once again. But real learning isn't just doing, but documenting and teaching. So here we are, 2019 and yeah ... I made a blog o_O

So here we are, the early days of 2019 and already so much has happened. So many opportunities, so may adventures already taken and so many more to come. I have had a pretty long career in front-end development and have seen much of the good, the bad and the really ugly, but along the way it has been an amazing learning experience.

#### So, why a new blog?

Easy really ... I used to blog a lot. There are a great number of articles I have written all over the internet. Some still relevant, while others have not really aged well. I had a pretty popular blog around 8 years ago, but yeah, it was Wordpress and it got mega hacked and I really never cared to get back into building another damn Wordpress blog. Since then friends and I have tried to make it easier to blog using Github and simple markdown architectures, but again, more work and more maintenance. All I want to do is write, not maintain web sites.

#### So, why now?

Again, easy. I have been hearing a lot about Gatsby and how easy it is to get up and running, so today I thought I would test it out. And guess what? The hype is real. Gone are the days of complicated setups. Away with mind numbing configs. I really did a search, found something I liked, installed it and started working. That's AWESOME!

## Why do you care?

That is a GREAT question. I don't know. Do you really care? Maybe, maybe not.

What makes this time exciting for me is, I am in a really great position to be learning and again be in the bleeding edge of how things are done.

I have had a great career designing and building things for a long list of clients to include Microsoft, REI, BestBuy, Getty Images, Code Fellows, AppDirect, and an even longer list of companies you may have never heard of. What's before me now is an opportunity to really use all of this knowledge and experience to lead a team into a new future.

Since about 2008 I have had a real infatuation for Design Systems. I started speaking at meetups, then conferences. I moved across the county in search of bigger and better opportunities to really explore this space. Along the way I have had some really amazing projects where I got to really exercise these skills. Even today, this is my focus. This is my passion and what makes today even more amazing is that we now have the tools to really deliver on a dream!

## Today is better than yesterday

Front end engineers have always wanted better tools. For so long we were trying to make the best of what we had, and over time it was just to damn hard to make great things with shitty tools.

All of that is changing in real time. Many say that web 4.0 is all about IoT, but I'd argue that web 4.0 also includes a real maturity of the web and how we can start to build web applications. And I am not simply talking about things like ES6 and the dominance of React. But what I am really talking about is a real maturity of the core tools of the web, HTML/CSS/JS. It took a really long time, but we finally have our heads wrapped around what it means to build libraries of native Web Components. This is HUGE in my opinion. There is so much space there to really grow a whole new development discipline.

So, here I am. Excited. Amazed. Hungry. Ready to dive into a new chapter of my life and build new things in new ways that brings to light the dreams we had as developers 10, 15 years ago. Standing on the shoulders of giants, I am ready once again to leap into the future.
